# Lorenz-Equations
Lorenz equations Differential Equations project. This project analyses the Lorenz differential equations and displays its applications. 



### Environment setup

1. Create a conda environment with the environment.yml file and activate the environment

   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yaml
   conda activate DE
   ```



### Running the code

1. Lorenz attractor, Bifurcation plots, live plotting

   ```bash
   python lorenz.py
   ```

2. Chua's circuit chaos 3D graph

   ```bash
   python chuachaos.py
   ```

3. Chua's  diode resistance vs. current 

   ```
   python chuadiode.py
   ```

4. Lyapunov distance vs. time

   ```
   python lyapunov.py
   ```
